# Test 60: filter:support

* The following had OK quality: default, 1.0–2.0 (which all seemed to be the same)

* 0.8 was close, so maybe 0.9 or something would work

* \> 1.0 actually seems to have very slightly smaller file sizes, though this seems to level out at about 2.0. I don’t *think* this is random.

* using 2.0 seems to be worthwhile
