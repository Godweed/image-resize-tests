# Test 11–12: unsharp gain

* Best quality was at 2.0

* Best file size was at highest tested, 1000, and looked like it would keep dropping

* The DSSIM and file size differences are pretty small; for consistency, I think I’ll just leave it the same as the optimized: 9.0

* This is close to the smallest file size, and the quality is not far off from what it is at 2.0 (and still well within out target)
