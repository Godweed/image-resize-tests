# Test 40: fuzz

* It looks like there’s no real effect — DSSIM is consistent, and most of the sizes are basically the same

* But, 70 and 100 actually *do* seem to have a difference in file size (more than I would expect from random variations)

* I think the difference @ 100 is too much to ignore, and including it doesn’t seem like it can’t hurt, so I’ll use it
