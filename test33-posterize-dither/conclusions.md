# Test 33: posterize + dither

* Meets quality reqs: pre-70, pre-80
* These have larger file sizes than doing nothing
* *But*, some others are *really close*; might be worth doing another round with 90, 100, etc
	* The file sizes for post and both at 80 are still well under doing nothing
* pre are consistently too big, so no need to test that
* both is consistently bigger than post, so no need to test that
