# Test 10: unsharp sigma

* Quality is pretty good for 0.0, 0.25, and 0.5, but 0.25 is best

* Exact same situation with file size; 0.25 is best.

* Again, I could try to pinpoint the exact best value between 0.0 and 0.5, but since 0.25 was the value recommended by <<http://redskiesatnight.com/2005/04/06/sharpening-using-image-magick/> (which said sigma should = radius if radius < 1), Iâ€™ll go with that
