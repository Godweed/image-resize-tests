# Test 76: bigger than original

* Changing the type caused major problems; errors with some images, and insanely huge DSSIM with others. Not recommended.

* So, looking at the colours: using the same # of colours as the original has a *huge* effect on file size. Each image in colours1 is way smaller than the original and default.

* The DSSIM for these individual files is fine too, except 3A-2 (which is not good with the default either)
