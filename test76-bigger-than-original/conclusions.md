# Test 76: bigger than original

* Changing the type caused major problems; errors with some images, and insanely huge DSSIM with others. Not recommended.

* So, looking at the colours: using the same # of colours as the original has an effect on file size, but not as big as Iâ€™d like. In general, images are smaller than default, but often still larger than the original.

* The DSSIM for these individual files is fine, except 3A-2 (which is not good with the default either)

* Overall still worth doing, but not as much of an effect as when we optimize
