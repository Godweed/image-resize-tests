# Test 18: colorspace

* none-none, none-srgb, rgb-none, rgb-srgb, srgb-none, srgb-srgb all tie for best DSSIM

* they all have the same file size too

* Despite what I did in the optimized tests, I’m going to go with none-srgb, because I want to be explicit about forcing srgb and it’s not detrimental
