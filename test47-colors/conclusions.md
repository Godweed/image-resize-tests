# Test 47: colors

* 7+ hits quality target

* But, everything other than 1 is a file size *increase*, which is obviously garbage

* TBH, everything looks fine, and 1x is *really* close to our targets â€” the overall mean is fine, but the JPEG mean and 600px mean are slightly high. If this was just me doing this on my site, I would do it, but for testing I need to stick within the limits I established.
