# Test 34: posterize + dither 2

* 140â€“180 hit our quality targets; 130 just misses out in the JPEG mean

* In general, higher posterize = more colours = bigger file size

* Of the ones that hit on quality, 140 has the smallest file size (and it is smaller than not doing posterize). Probably worth seeing if we can find something that works even better between 130 and 140.
