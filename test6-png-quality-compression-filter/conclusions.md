# Test 6: PNG quality — compression-filter

* 5–9 have lowest file size pre-optimization

* As expected, completely uniform quality across the board (since this compression is lossless)

* Shockingly, there were very minute file size differences. Realistically, these are completely negligible and probably has more to do with the specific corpus of images than anything else. But, since the quality is completely equal across the board, I’ll go with `2`, which had the smallest file size by a tiny margin. This is "up" filtering.
