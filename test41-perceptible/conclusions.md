# Test 41: perceptible

* The quality needs to get *really* bad before we start seeing any savings

* BTW, I had *no idea* what kind of values to choose

* The file size results for `none` show that the savings from the last test, with `-fuzz 100%`, were a random fluke, so Iâ€™ll remove that going forward
