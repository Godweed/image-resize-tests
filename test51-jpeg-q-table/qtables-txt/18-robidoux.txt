# April Fool's quantization table

# Dr. Nicolas Robidoux, Senior Research Scientist at Phase One

# Named in honour of the April 20th, 2013, snow storm that befell my
# soon to be former home town Sudbury Ontario, as well as the May 1st
# snow storm that welcomed my wife Cheryl more than a few years ago.

# Happy Anniversary Cheryl!

# ("A JPEG quantization table! Just what I wanted.")

# RECOMMENDED USE

# Warning: Without Chroma subsampling, this table allocates too many
# bits to colour preservation.

# Tuned for use with Chroma subsampling ("-sample 2x2" with cjpeg) in
# the IJG quality range 60 to 80 in viewing conditions appropriate for
# 20/20 vision when viewed at native size or enlarged 2x. (Pixel
# peepers: Stay away!)

# One single table is used for all three channels. Using the same
# quantization table for both Luma and Chroma allows one to embed only
# one in the image file (using the "-qslots 0" cjpeg option), which
# yields a nontrivial size reduction with very small
# thumbnails.

# This quantization table is based on the one recommended by

# Relevance of human vision to JPEG-DCT compression by Stanley
# A. Klein, Amnon D. Silverstein and Thom Carney. In Human Vision,
# Visual Processing and Digital Display III, 1992.

# for 1 minute per pixel viewing.

# I decided to simply add 5 across the board, the numerological rationale being
# that 5 is the single digit number with the highest level of vibrational energy.
