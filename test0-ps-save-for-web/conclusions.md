# Test 0: Photoshop CC 2014 vs Photoshop CS 5

* *Very* slight difference in quality in 18 out of 56 PNGs. Everything else is unchanged in terms of quality.

* Filesize is *very* similar as well, but actually slightly worse than with CS 5 â€” on average 531 bytes bigger, 1 byte different for JPEGs and 1,179 bytes for PNGs.

* Not enough to bother switching to this or re-running any tests, but something to be aware of.
