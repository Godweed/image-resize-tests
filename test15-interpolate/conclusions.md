# Test 15: interpolation setting

* I’m shocked that the DSSIM scores are identical across the board. I’m guessing either something is wrong with my test, or interpolate just doesn’t play that big a role when shrinking with `distort`

* There are small differences in file size, so I guess that’s what I’ll go on. Based on that, `Mesh` is the best option. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

* I feel weird about this result.
