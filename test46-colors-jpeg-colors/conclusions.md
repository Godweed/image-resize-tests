# Test 46: colors/jpeg:colors

* This was testing forcing the output to have no more colors than the input

* `jpeg:colors` had no effect

* `colors` had a drastic effect, but was just slightly outside of the quality target.

* I’m going to try using a few more colors than were in the input — try multiplying by 2, 3, etc.
