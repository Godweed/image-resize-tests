# Test 12: unsharp gain 2

* OK, finally we’re getting somewhere. Here, DSSIM is best at 9.0, suggesting that the best value lies somewhere between 8.0 and 10.0

* I’m inclined to just leave it at 9.0, since we’re talkng about such small differences

* There’s a difference between PNG and JPEG here, too…

* For file size, 10.0 is the lowest overall. But, for JPEGs 8.0 is the lowest and for PNGs…10.0 is

* I don’t know man… I’m going to go with 9.0 and leave it at that. Seems like a decent enough compromise.
